A shell is a program to interact with the OS. It is command line interpreter which receives and understands commands from the user and sends them to the kernel for execution via system calls

Bash is a type of shell

Bash scripts are a list of commands which can be understood by the shell

File extension: `.sh`

## Executing a bash script

```bash
bash script.sh
OR
chmod +x script.sh # Give it executable perms
./script.sh
```

## Shabang line

All bash scripts start with a shabang line which is to indicate to the OS which program is to be used execute the code

```bash
#!/bin/bash
```

## Variables

- Local - Can only be used in the current terminal
- Environment - Can be used in any terminal
- Shell - Set by the shell and is required it to work

```bash
Syntax: variableName=value
```

**There must not be spaces between the = and variableName and between the = and value**

```bash
i=1 # Integer
d=1.3 # Decimal
s="Hello World!" # String
```

Variables can be referenced in other parts of the program by prepending a $ to the variableName

## Make variables read only

Readonly is a property which can be set to a variable to prevent its value from being changed again. Its value can only be read

```bash
Syntax: readonly variableName


readonly i
readonly secret
```

## Unsetting variables

Removing the current value of  avariable

```bash
Syntax: unset variableName

unset name
unset abcd
```

## Printing output

```bash
Syntax: echo $variableName or echo value

echo hi
echo Hello World!
echo 10

echo $a
echo $msg
echo "Your name is $name and your age is $age"
```

## Taking input

### read

```bash
Syntax: read variableToStoreData

read a
echo $a
```

You can also display a message when taking input using read

```bash
Syntax: read -p "Message" variableToStoreData

read -p "Enter your name: " name
```

### Positional arguments

```bash
./script.sh argument1 argument2 ...
```

These are values are stored in special variables which are from $0 to $9

```bash
     $0      $1    $2
./script.sh hello world

 $0     $1     $2  $3 $4
bash script.sh add 10 26
```

```bash
echo $0

a=$1+$2
echo$a
```

## Conditional statements

### if statement

```bash
Syntax:

if [ Condition ]
then
	Statements
fi

Condition = value1 <Relational Operator> value2 
```

Relational operators for numbers:
- -eq -> Checks if the values are equal
- -ne -> Checks if the values are not equal
- -gt -> Checks if value1 is greater than value2
- -ge -> Checks if value1 is greater than or equal to value2
- -lt -> Checks if value1 is lesser than value2
- -le -> Checks if value1 is lesser than or equal to value2

```bash
if [ 1 -eq 1 ]
then
	echo "1 = 1!"
fi
```

For strings, the only relational operators are `==`  to check if the strings are equal and `!=` to check if the strings are not equal

### else statement

```bash
Syntax:

if [ Condition ]
then
	Statements
	
else
	Statements
	
fi
```

```bash
if [ $a -lt $b ]
then
	echo "$a is less than $b"
	
else
	echo "$a is greater than $b"
	
fi
```
